React.js

Use React Strict Mode 


Set up a backend server:

    Use Node.js with Express.js to create a RESTful API.
    Connect to a MongoDB database using Mongoose, an ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.

Create API endpoints:

    Create endpoints for adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting events.

Modify React frontend:

    Update your frontend to make HTTP requests to the backend server to fetch and manage events.
    Use Axios for the HTTP requests.

React + Node.js + MongoDB provides a more modular approach with a separation between front-end and back-end, allowing for flexibility and modern JavaScript practices. Helps build a highly interactive front end and has a more decoupled architecture.
